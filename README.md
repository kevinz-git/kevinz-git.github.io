### Projects

# [Project 1: Customer Retention Prediction](https://github.com/kevinz-git/customer_retention_predicion_logistic_knn_CART_RF/blob/main/docs/hudm-project.ipynb)
This project predicted the customer retention rate by customer info using regression and machine learning, built logistic regression, kNN, CART and random forest model and compared best prediction model in Python. The model reached the highest of 86% accuracy with random forest and CART model.

# [Project 2: Student Life Dissatisfication Prediction](https://kevinz-git.github.io/student_life_satisfaction_clustering/)
This project made exploratory data analysis, prediction and visualization of student life dissatification, and found potential predictors of student life dissatisfication.  I first made k-means and hierarchical clustering analysis and visualization for students and variables related with student life dissatisfaction in R, and Investigated the patterns of 90k students' life satisfaction and the potential grouping of students. I then	made a random forest prediction model of 70% accuracy and identified key predictors for making future psychological health recommendations to students.

# [Project 3: F1 Drivers’ Race Ranking Prediction](https://github.com/kevinz-git/F1_driver_ranking_prediction_elastic_net_regression/blob/main/Elastic-Net%20Regression%20Models.py)            
This project used F1 driver's dataset and predicted F1 drivers’ ranking in each race using range, fastest speed, timing of speed, age, etc. by building an elastic net regression model to improve prediction results and feature selection in Pyspark with Databricks platform.

# [Project 4: Big Money Test Regression](https://kevinz-git.github.io/big_money_test_regression/)
This project analyzed UK's Big Money Test survey data to understand wealth accumulation status in different age, income, education level and financial behavior. It uses regression to see the variables influencing wealth accumulation.

# [Project 5: Stock Market Risk Management by VaR Calculation](https://kevinz-git.github.io/stock_market_risk_management_by_VaR_calculation/)
This project used stock dataset to calculate optimal asset allocations under financial theories of risk and returns, as well as estimating VaR( Value at Risk) by stocks' past performance, in order to aid investment risk management.
